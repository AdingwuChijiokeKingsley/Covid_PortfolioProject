# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
Skills Demonstrated: SQL Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Data Type Conversions, Views Creation

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing global COVID-19 data using SQL to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets. The objective is to explore key pandemic trends, such as infection and mortality rates, vaccination progress, and the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and continents.

# Key Insights & Analysis:
✔ COVID-19 Infection Trends – Analyzed the total cases per country and calculated the percentage of the population infected over time.
✔ Mortality Analysis – Evaluated the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19 by comparing total deaths against total cases.
✔ Global & Continental Breakdown – Identified countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates.
✔ Vaccination Progress – Assessed the percentage of the population that received vaccinations, using window functions for cumulative calculations.
✔ Data Transformation & Cleaning – Handled missing values, converted data types, and created staging tables for structured analysis.

# Tools & Techniques Used:
SQL Queries & Data Cleaning – Used UPDATE, WHERE, CASE, and NULL handling to clean raw data.
Aggregations & Joins – Combined multiple datasets to analyze relationships between infections, deaths, and vaccinations.
Window Functions & CTEs – Implemented rolling calculations for vaccination tracking.
Views & Temp Tables – Created reusable queries for efficient data exploration.

# Project Impact:
This analysis provides a structured way to assess the impact of COVID-19 worldwide, offering valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.
